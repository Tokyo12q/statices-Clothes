Clothing Dataset - Statistics Project

This project explores a dataset containing information about various clothing items. The dataset includes the following features:

-Brand – The name of the clothing brand

-Category – Type of clothing (e.g., shirt, pants, dress)

-Color – The main color of the item

-Size – Available size (e.g., S, M, L, XL)

-Material – The fabric or material used (e.g., cotton, polyester)

-Price – Price of the clothing item in USD

We use statistical techniques to analyze trends, relationships, and patterns within the dataset. The goal is to understand how different factors such as brand, size, and material relate to pricing and categorization.
